# :joystick: Snake Game using Pyxel

This is just a simple version of snake, I created to learn the basics of Pyxel.

# Installation & How To Use

Installation is pretty straight forward, Im using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage everything.

First if you dont Poetry installed run this:

```
pipx install poetry
```

Then install the dependencies with:

```
poetry install
```

To run it simply:

```
poetry run python ./snake/snake.py

```
